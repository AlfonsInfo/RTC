This project is a Remote Control Car that was built using the Arduino Mega (with an Atmega 2560 processor). We built this robot to simulate transporter missions, so we added a claw with 1 dof to lift objects. We use the NRF24L01 module for communication. We also made the controller manually using Arduino Mega as well

Materials :
Car : Arduino Mega, Servo MG90, Servo MG995, Motor Driver, Motor, Arduino Wheel, Breadboard mini, Lipo Battery.
Controller : Arduino Mega, Joystick, potentiometer, breadboard, switch button, Lipo Battery.
